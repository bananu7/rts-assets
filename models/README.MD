# Guidelines for models for the rts game

## All models

* Units for players should export a material called `Accent` that will be replaced by the player color.

## Buildings

* Default building size is 6x6 units
* Buildings should go in `+X` and `-Y` in Blender, with "top left" corner at `(0,0)`
